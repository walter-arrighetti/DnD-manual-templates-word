# DnD-manual-templates-word
MS *Word* template for **Dungeons &amp; Dragons**® unofficial *Rules Supplement*s.

This is a project started (and ended) several years, ago, delivering two Microsoft *Word* templates (old Word 97-2003 `.dot` file format) mocking up the principal manuals' desktop publishing style of two different historical editions of the [*Dungeons & Dragons*®](https://dnd.wizards.com/) role-playing game by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com):
 * ***Advanced Dungeons & Dragons***® *2nd Edition*, including the so-called "2.5 Edition" (*Skills & Powers* Player's and DM's Options)
 * ***Dungeons & Dragons***® *3.5 Edition*

The above templates have been used by the author to type manual with additional, unofficial rule set for the former edition of the two: the *AD&D® Expanded Player's Handbook* (presented here in rendered in PDF file format). In particular, the additional rules, valid for 2nd Edition of the famous RPG game, include general, as well Campaign Setting specific rules.
In particular, rules in this manual, even if copied from other official rules, were ported from pure 2nd Edition to 2.5 Edition, that is: using race points (RPs) and class points (CPs) at character's creation; using MTHAC0/MAC based psionic powers; combining 2.5 Edition RP/CP framework with 2nd Edition class-based kits; revisiting 2nd-Edition Campaign Settings of AD&D® ‒ like *Al-Qadim*™, *Dark Sun*® ('legacy' and 'new' edition), *Planescape*® ‒ to 2.5 Edition.

The templates contain, as part of their sample text and images, the instructions on how to used them. This is particularly useful for wider adience of at-large rule creators, whose experience in typesetting software (e.g. Microsoft *Word*) and professional desktop publishing concepts in general in *not* required. Please read carefully the instruction typeset within the templates to respect all the subtlelties of mocking a professional desktop publishing template in a standard typesetting software (*Word*), in order not to screw the technical threads that tie the templates' aspects and automations together.

Last but not least, subfolders inside the `fonts/` folder contain the OpenType / TrueType fonts required for each templates.
