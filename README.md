This is a project started in 2007, that delivered two Microsoft *Word* templates (old Word 97-2003 `.dot` file format) mocking up the desktop-publishing style of core manuals of two different historical editions of the [*Dungeons & Dragons*®](https://dnd.wizards.com/) role-playing game by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com):
 * ***Advanced Dungeons & Dragons***® *2nd Edition*, including the so-called "2.5 Edition" (Player's and DM's Options);
 * ***Dungeons & Dragons***® *3rd* and *3.5 Edition*s.

The above templates are under the `templates/` subfolder of the project.

Please also consider that, in order to properly render the templates, you need to  install several fonts and procure the appropriate licenses for, whenever those are protected by additional (commercial or noncommercial) licenses. For the sole purpose of referencing such fonts' full names (and their TrueType/OpenType filenames), have a look at the `fonts/` subfolder.

The above templates have been used by the author to type manuals with additional, unofficial rule set for former editions of the RPG: the *AD&D® Expanded Player's Handbook* (presented rendered in PDF file format). In particular, the additional rules, valid for 2nd Edition of the famous RPG game, include general, as well Campaign Setting specific rules.
In particular, rules in this manual, even if copied from other official rules, were ported from pure 2nd Edition to 2.5 Edition, that is: using race points (RPs) and class points (CPs) at character's creation; using MTHAC0/MAC based psionic powers; combining 2.5 Edition RP/CP framework with 2nd Edition class-based kits; revisiting 2nd-Edition Campaign Settings of AD&D® ‒ like *Al-Qadim*™, *Dark Sun*® (both the former and latter 2nd-Edition versions), *Planescape*® ‒ to 2.5 Edition.

The templates contain, as part of  sample text and images, instructions on how to use them. This is particularly useful to a wider audience of at-large rule creators, to whom some experience in typesetting software (e.g. Microsoft *Word*) and professional desktop publishing concepts in general in required. Please read carefully the instructions in templates' texts to respect all the subtlelties of dealing professional desktop publishing template in a standard typesetting software (*Word*). This is particularly relevant in order not to screw the technical threads that tie the templates' aspects and automations together.

**DISCLAIMER**: The package is provided *as is* and the fonts referenced in the `fonts/` subfolder and subfolders therein have been downloaded from free sources online. However, no fonts can be used in any publications, unless the author procures the corresponding (commercial or noncommercial) licenses for, for those fonts which do have any. The author is therefore not responsible for any font license infringement of third authors who are using this respository or any of its derivative works.
